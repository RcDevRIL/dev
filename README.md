# Draft dev repository

Welcome in my work-study program development repository!! 

    I would put here some of the projects/exercises done during my RIL work-study program
    with the CESI School in Dijon, France.
    
    You can also find personal projects.
    
    Use it for you as much as you want!
  
Distributed by me :-)

## Getting Started

These following sections will give you an insight of the repository and I hope will help you identify what could peak your interest.

    I should mention that my Git skills are basics and so don't expect a lisible nor a logical history !

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install and how to install them(nope!)

    To get a copy of my repo you'll need to smh clone using Git, and I assume
    you don't need explanations as you're browsing GitHub :D
    
    Some of my projects, especially flutter ones, can only be run with the 
    necessary tools, but this is not the aim of this README.
